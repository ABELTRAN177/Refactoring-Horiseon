## Description
Over the course of the first week of the bootcamp we were instructed to refactor or condense starter code provided. Multiple lines of code are repeated throughtout the file and we were instructed to reduce redundancy all whilist keeping the webpage looking the same. A fun excercise that tested the untrained eye to pay attention to small subtle details that could change based on small changes made on the CSS style sheet.
